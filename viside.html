                <h3>Growth: Vision and Identity</h3>
                <p>Â At the start of the year, these terms were very vague to me. I didn't really realize what my vision and identity were. Therefore it was hard to formulate a vision and identity. I did the CANVAS excersises we were handed, but this didn't really make anything more clear. That's why the vision and identity that are in my PDP are far from perfect.
                    <br/>
                    <br/> Throughout the year, I think I got a clearer idea on both my vision and identity. Even though I don't have a real identity yet, I can say that I fully agree with what I have written down. I realize how important both vision and identity are. They don't only help you realize who you are as a designer, and what you want to accomplish which way, but they also make this clear to people around you. I hope I will be able to get an even more clear vision on both. </p>
