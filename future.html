                <h3>Future</h3>
                <p> For the future, I want to focus on the business aspect of design more. I sadly didn't get the chance to work on that this year, and therefore I chose to do a USE learning line that will focus on that, next year. I hope this will give me the desired growth. 
                    <br/>
                    <br/>As for the rest of this bachelor, I hope I can keep on focusing on many areas. I find interaction within design very cool, and hope I will be able to focus on that more. For my next year project, my first choice went to "Crafting everyday soft things". I hope this project will help me focus on the things I want.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>I really hope I get to do that project because it seems very interesting to me. On the other expertise areas, I think my growth is good enough. I don't find User and Society too interesting right now, so I won't really focus on that. I hope I will be able to pass this year, since I really enjoyed this year and I hope I can continue this study next year. </p>
