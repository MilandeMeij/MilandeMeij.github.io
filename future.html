                <h3>Future</h3>
                <p> For the future, I want to focus on the business aspect of design more. I sadly didn't get the chance to work on that this year, and therefore I chose to do a USE learning line that will focus on that, next year. I hope this will give me the desired growth. On the other expertise areas, I think my growth is good enough. I don't find User and Society too interesting right now, so I won't really focus on that. I'm very happy with my growth on the other three areas, and I still want to keep on developping on those areas. But, the relative growth I want to have on those areas, compared to what it is now, I smaller than my desired growth on Business and Entrepreneurship.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>As for the rest of this bachelor, I hope I can keep focusing on many areas. I find the interaction within design very interesting, and hope I will be able to focus on that more. For my project next year, my first choice went to "Crafting everyday soft things". Hopefully, this project will help me improve on the areas I want. 
                    <br/>
                    <br/>Another point I want to develop myself on is my professional behaviour, during the year, I have not always behaved the way I should have, I didn't use the tools the TU/e handed me enough. I progressed a lot on my participation but this still needs to be better if I want to become a professional designer. I know I can improve on this area, since I have already grown a lot on this area this year. <br/>
