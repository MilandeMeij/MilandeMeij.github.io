                <h3>Vision</h3>
                <p>Â For me, the most important thing in design is making optimal use of the newest technologies and creating beautiful products by using these new techniques. Stimulating innovation is something the TU/e is known for and something designers should aim for when designing products. <br/><br/>
In our current society it seems people have difficulty connecting with products. I want to solve this problem by creating product that engage with the user and establish a deeper connection. My products should mostly serve people who are having a difficult time, and therefore this engagement with the user is even more important. When users can connect with the product they use, they often find it easier to use the product in the desired way. Which, especially with products that use new technologies, can benefit users a lot. 
<br/><br/>With my design, I want to help people. I want to show people what new technologies are capable of, and what true engagement can do. Technology is evolving rapidly, and it can be used even more optimally than it is used right now.</p>
