                <h3>Vision</h3>
                <p> There’s multiple things within design that I find really interesting at this point in time. One of them being lighting. Which is why I chose lighting as a final project subject. I think for now that the most important thing in design would be making optimal use of the newest technologies and creating stunningly beautiful products using those things. And this is something the TU/e is known for.
                <br/>
                <br/>But this keyboard also represents something else, quality. Or actually misrepresents. I have used this keyboard quite a bit, but the build quality is just not good enough for me. It broke down quite often so I decided to return it. I find this aspect even more important than aesthetics, I want to make products that not only look good, but that also function perfectly.
                <br/>
                <br/>So for now, I think the aesthetics of a product are important. Also, I like products that just like my keyboard, go on an engagement with its user. I’ve followed a course this year that involved prototyping with the aim to create products that look good, but more important, connect with its user.</p>
