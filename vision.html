                <h3>Vision</h3>
                <p>Â The most important thing in design is making optimal use of the newest technologies and creating beautiful products using these Technologies. Innovation, something the TU/e is known for. <br/>Creating regular products using new techniques, or using new technologies within your products.
                <br/>

                <br/>In our current society, people find alot of difficulties connecting with products. This problem can be solved if products could connect with their users more easily. Products should go on an engagement with its user. There should be a connection between the user and the product. Products should mostly serve people who are having a difficult time, and therefore connecting with the user is even more important. When users can connect with the product they use, they often find it easier to use the product in the desired way. Which, especially with products that use new technologies that are sometimes hard to understand, can benefit users a lot. <br/><br/>
                With my design, I want to help people. I want to show people what new technologies are capable of, and what true engagement can do. Technology is evolving rapidly, and it can be used even more optimally than it is used right now.</p>
