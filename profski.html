                <h3>Growth: Professional Skills</h3>
                <p>Â I think I have gotten a lot better at reflecting throughout this year. At first, I didn't really like it, I thought that it was annoying that we had to make a reflection after every subject we did. But looking back at it I think it was really handy at the end. And since I got better at reflecting itself throughout the year as well, I started to have less issues with it as well.
<br/><br/>
My communication skills has grown a lot, I tried to improve this skill a lot since I realized it was lacking at the start of the year, and during the final year project I tried to very active in my group, and also have input during meetings.
<br/><br/>
Another point I had issues with was planning and organisation. Luckily enough I had some groupmates who were already very good at this and they helped me a lot by making plannings for us four. This helped me improve a lot on this skill.
<br/><br/>
I haven't improved a lot of the area of dealing with scientific information. I didn't really use too many sources throughout this year so it didn't cause any issues. I did go to the workshop about this subject, and I passed the assignment we had to make.
