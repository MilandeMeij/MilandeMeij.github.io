                <h3>Growth: Professional Skills</h3>
                <p>Â I have gotten a lot better at reflecting throughout this year. At first, I didn't really like it, I thought that it was annoying that we had to make a reflection after every subject we did. But looking back at it, I think it was really handy at the end. And since I got better at reflecting itself throughout the year as well, I started to have less issues with it. I realize now, that when youre doing a more in depth reflection, you get a good overview on what you learned from a course, and what you want to do with the knowledge you gained or what you want to do different next time.
<br/><br/>
My communication skills have grown a lot, I tried to improve this skill a lot since I realized it was lacking at the start of the year. During the first year project I tried to be very active in my group, and also have input during meetings. Which lead to both me and my groupmates being very content. We also had some pitching workshops, which were very nice to have, but I was already pretty good at pitching itself. I was lacking more on the teamwork communication part.
<br/><br/>
Other points I had issues with, were planning and organisation. Luckily enough, I had some groupmates who were already very good at this and they helped a lot by taking the lead when making plannings for us all. This helped me improve a lot on this skill. I tried to make plannings on my own, and test out some other ways of working that might help me structure my work more, which worked very well. I had this (become better at planning) as a goal in my PDP as well, and I feel like I accomplished it.
<br/><br/>
I haven't improved a lot of the area of dealing with scientific information. I didn't use too many sources throughout this year, so it didn't cause any issues. I did go to the workshop on this subject, and I passed the assignment we had to make.
