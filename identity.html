                <h3>Identity</h3>
                <p>Â I have not developed a full identity yet. Which is not necessarily a problem. There's still plenty of time to develop a clear identity. I should be more professional next year. I didn't always take the tools that were handed to me that serious, and looking back at it, that was not smart. I learned a lot about my strenghts, and mostly weaknesses. At the start of projects I have trouble taking part in the group. This has gotten better throughout the year, and I have a lot of faith in my first second year project.
                <br/>
                <br/> As stated in my vision, I try to create engagements between users and products. This can be done at a very basic level, by making a simple interactive product. But, I like to go deeper into that connection, and try to make this engagement even stronger by adding other details to the products. For example, our final project products were supposed to be touched by the user, after which they lit up and guided the user through his morning routine. These products had a structure on their surface to stimulate the user even more. <br/>
                <br/>
                The best way to improve those connections, is making prototypes. This is a very pleasant way to work for me, because you can immediately find out wether your ideas work in reality. I don't see myself taking a leader position very often, which is not a problem for me. But, when prototyping I like things to go my way, often taking a leader role.</p>
