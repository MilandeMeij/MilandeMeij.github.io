                <h3>Past</h3>
                <p>Â I have always been creative, as a small child I loved to play around with LEGO, painting, drawing and crafting things.
                This was all at a very basic level, I had never worked on a real long project.
                <br/>I was always interested in technologies, which is the reason I decided to go to Eindhoven instead of Delft, since this study incorporates technology more compared to Delft. <br/><br/>
                    I never had to work really hard during high school. Which made the transition to university a bit difficult. It was a whole new way of working / learning for me. But I think I adapted to it nicely during the year. In high school, almost all the work I did was individual work, and since everything went fairly easy for me, I barely had to anyone into account while doing work.
