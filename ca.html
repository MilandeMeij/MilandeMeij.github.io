                <h3>Creativity and Aesthetics</h3>
                <p>Â I did not have too much experience in this area. I think most people who start this study have some experience being creative, but this was only on a very basic level.I add a lot of value to this expertise, because aesthetics are very important in design.
                    <br/>
                    <br/> I have developed a lot in this area. This was mainly because, throughout the year, I put a lot of focus on making nice things, and trying to make good looking things. Halfway through the year, I was not satisfied with how much I had done in this first half of the year. When I compared my creations to those of other people, I felt like mine weren't good enough. <br/><br/>But throughout the second half of the year, during the project, I became more and more happy with the things I made. I developed this area a lot, I am very happy with the final prototypes that we created during the final design project.  </p>
